A listed peer is alive and will process your message — no "busy" state; messages enqueue and drain at the receiver's next tool round. Your message arrives wrapped as \`<cross-session-message from="...">\`. **To reply to an incoming message, copy its \`from\` attribute as your \`to\`.**`

# SendMessage

Send a message to another agent.

{"to": "researcher", "summary": "assign task 1", "message": "start on task #1"}

| \`to\` | |
|---|---|
| \`"researcher"\` | Teammate by name |
| \`"*"\` | Broadcast to all teammates — expensive (linear in team size), use only when everyone genuinely needs it |${udsRow}

Your plain text output is NOT visible to other agents — to communicate, you MUST call this tool. Messages from teammates are delivered automatically; you don't check an inbox. Refer to teammates by name, never by UUID. When relaying, don't quote the original — it's already rendered to the user.${udsSection}

## Recommended threaded teamwork

For real collaboration, prefer structured \`team_event\` messages instead of plain text when the conversation may continue:

\`\`\`json
{"to": "qa", "message": {"type": "team_event", "kind": "question", "topic": "login edge cases", "body": "Can you validate the password reset path before I merge?", "requires_response": true}}
{"to": "frontend", "message": {"type": "team_event", "kind": "handoff", "thread_id": "reuse-the-same-thread-id", "body": "QA confirmed the bug. Please patch the error state.", "priority": "high"}}
{"to": "qa", "message": {"type": "team_event", "kind": "answer", "thread_id": "reuse-the-same-thread-id", "reply_to": "event-id-here", "body": "Validated. The reset path still breaks on expired tokens."}}
\`\`\`

Do not wait until your entire task is done to contact a teammate. If you are blocked, need validation, or want a parallel check, send the message immediately and keep the shared \`thread_id\` alive.

## Protocol responses (legacy)

If you receive a JSON message with \`type: "shutdown_request"\` or \`type: "plan_approval_request"\`, respond with the matching \`_response\` type — echo the \`request_id\`, set \`approve\` true/false:

\`\`\`json
{"to": "team-lead", "message": {"type": "shutdown_response", "request_id": "...", "approve": true}}
{"to": "researcher", "message": {"type": "plan_approval_response", "request_id": "...", "approve": false, "feedback": "add error handling"}}
\`\`\`

Approving shutdown terminates your process. Rejecting plan sends the teammate back to revise. Don't originate \`shutdown_request\` unless asked. Don't send structured JSON status messages — use TaskUpdate.
